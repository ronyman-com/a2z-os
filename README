### **2.2 `architecture.md`**
```markdown
# System Architecture

This document provides an overview of the A2Z Operator System architecture.

## Components
1. **Kernel**:
   - Handles memory management, process scheduling, and hardware interaction.
2. **File System**:
   - Manages files and directories.
3. **Drivers**:
   - Provides support for hardware devices like keyboards, displays, and storage.

## Boot Process
1. The bootloader loads the kernel into memory.
2. The kernel initializes hardware and starts the shell.


# API Reference

This document lists the APIs available for developers working on the A2Z Operator System.

## Kernel APIs
- `void create_process(void (*entry_point)())`: Create a new process.
- `void sleep(uint32_t milliseconds)`: Pause the current process.

## File System APIs
- `void fs_create_file(char* name, uint32_t size, uint8_t* data)`: Create a file.
- `struct file* fs_open_file(char* name)`: Open a file.

# Benchmarks

This document provides performance benchmarks for the A2Z Operator System.

## Metrics
1. **Boot Time**: 2.5 seconds.
2. **Context Switch Time**: 0.1 milliseconds.
3. **File System Read Speed**: 100 MB/s.

For optimization tips, refer to the [Optimization Guide](./optimization_guide.md).


# Optimization Guide

This guide provides tips for optimizing the performance of the A2Z Operator System.

## Techniques
1. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data to reduce memory access time.
2. **Parallelization**: Use multiple CPU cores for task execution.
3. **Kernel Preemption**: Allow higher-priority tasks to interrupt lower-priority tasks.

For benchmarks, refer to the [Benchmarks Guide](./benchmarks.md).
